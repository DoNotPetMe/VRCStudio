# VRC Studio

A desktop companion app for VRChat. Friends, worlds, avatars, OSC, a
Discord bot, video player tracking, themes, and a lot more — all local

Built with Electron + React + TypeScript. Best on Windows 10/11.

> ⚠️ **Heads up — VRC Studio is still in its testing phase.** Expect bugs
> and things that don't behave as intended. Everything gets fixed over
> time. Thanks for your patience!

## 📥 Installation

1. **[Download the ZIP](https://github.com/DoNotPetMe/VRCStudio/archive/refs/heads/claude/vrchat-companion-app-e7eJL.zip)** and extract it anywhere.
2. **Double-click `Start Here.bat`.**

It checks for Node.js (installs it for you if missing), asks if you want
`VRC Studio.exe` on your Desktop, builds the app, and launches it.

> **If the build fails with a "symbolic link / privilege not held" error,**
> enable Developer Mode in *Settings → For developers → Developer Mode*
> and re-run, or run `Start Here.bat` as Administrator.

## 📝 Notes

- **Unofficial** — third-party app, not affiliated with VRChat Inc.
- **Local-first** — no telemetry, no remote server.
- **Open source** — all code in this repo.
- **A few easter eggs sprinkled here and there.** 🥚
- **Transparency** — I value transparency, AI was used as an assistant
  in the making of VRC Studio. I am a one-person operation and tools
  like these help me search for bugs and squish them. Thank you for
  understanding.
